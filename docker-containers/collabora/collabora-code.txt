# Instructions to run Collabora-Code server

git clone https://github.com/iamjavadali/solrstation.git

cd solrstation/docker-containers/collabora

# Edit the collabora-code.sh file

nano collabora-code.sh

# edit the following variables

domain=###.###.###.###:PORT # Set this to the IP+Port pointing to the collabora/code server
server_name=your-domain.com #S et this to the domain pointed to your collabora/code server
user=admin # change this username for admin panel
pass=password # change this password for admin panel
tz=America/New_York # change this for your local timezone

# save and check if file is executable

chmod +x collabora-code.sh

# run the script

./collabora-code.sh

# In your nextcloud installation head over to administration settings -> Office
# Select "Use your own server"
# Enter URL (and Port) of collabora Online-server: example: use either domain or server_name values - https://office.solrstation.com or https://192.168.1.101:9980
# Allow list for WOPI requests: enter the following - 172.70.0.0/16, 162.158.0.0/16

# you can find the IP range of your WOPI host by entering 0.0.0.0 in your WOPI allow list and then openingup a document in nextcloud to get the WOPI denied error. Upon recieving this error you can look at the logs in your administration settings for warnings on WOPI request denied.
# example: WOPI request denied from 172.70.111.138 as it does not match the configured ranges: 0.0.0.0
# take the denied from IP and turn it into a range by keeping the first two values. example: 172.70
# then enter .0.0/16 to the end of it. example: 172.70.0.0/16
# try opening a document again and you will get another WOPI denied error, this time showing you another ip range.
# example: WOPI request denied from 162.158.154.60 as it does not match the configured ranges: 172.70.0.0/16
# add this IP like you did before to your WOPI allow list by keeping the first 2 parts of the IP and turning the remaining into a range: example: 162.158.0.0/16
# combine both IP ranges together and add them into your WOPI allow list
example: 172.70.0.0/16, 162.158.0.0/16
# open a document again in nextcloud, now you should not have any WOPI errors and the document should open with out any further errors.
