**Solr Station**

Solar Powered Home Lab Docker Server on Raspberry Pi 4

I have created guides for your Home lab server running docker containers on a single board computer (sbc), the Raspberry Pi 4. This SBC is powerful yet energy-efficient enough that your solar array can easily power this 100% renewable and free.

4.	NextCloud-DB **(MariaDB)**

6.	NGINX Proxy Manager
7.	NGINX Proxy Manager **(MariaDB)**
8.	NGINX Proxy Manager Stats - GoAccess Charts **(Nginx)**
9.	Plex
10.	FileBrowser
11.	Transmission
12.	Minecraft Server
13.	OnlyOfficeServer
14. HomeAssistant

Current Containers **How-to** are in the process of uploading to **solrstation/Docker** repo:
