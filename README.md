Solar Powered Home Lab Docker Server on Raspberry Pi 4

I have created guides for your Home lab server running docker containers on a single board computer (sbc), the Raspberry Pi 4. This SBC is powerful yet energy-efficient enough that your solar array can easily power this 100% renewable and free.

4.	NGINX Stats - GoAccess Charts
5.	NextCloud
6.	NextCloud-DB (MariaDB)
7.	NextCloud-Redis(Alpine)
8.	OnlyOfficeServer

Expect the following soon:
